      <p>
        Hey there! I'm Ryan, a passionate front-end developer with a knack for
        building sleek, modern, and user-friendly applications. Based in Provo,
        Utah, I draw inspiration from the mountains and the vibrant tech
        community here.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started my journey in software development during my time at Brigham
        Young University, where I majored in computer science. Over the years,
        I've honed my skills in React, JavaScript, and other modern web
        technologies, always striving to create apps that balance functionality
        and design.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new hiking trails,
        practicing chess strategies, or diving into a good book.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fun fact: I believe technology should empower people, and I aim to
        create solutions that make a difference. Feel free to reach outâ€”I'd love
        to connect!
      </p>
